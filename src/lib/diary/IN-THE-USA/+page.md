SO. <br>

I am well and alive. Got a new laptop just 3 days ago as my laptop gave up midway. I got a new one.
<br>
LENOVO IDEAPAD PRO 5i
<br>

I think I will need this monster for my workloads for next 5 years. And now I can finally continue journaling.
It's been quite a long time, A MONTH, since I wrote anything and I have a lot to say.

First of all.
I reached USA all safe and sound. I flew from Qatar Airways, from KTM to IAD(Washington). Flight was supposed to be good as we took a long time to plan my flight and it was supposed to be my first international flight but. BUT. Qatar airways let me down. First of all they didn't give me the seat we booked. That's kind of bad and the flight crew was so unprofessional. Yuck. I wrote them a long complaint about their wrong doings and I don't think I will fly with them again. EVER.

Second. Everything went great. I reached USA all fine and dandy. Visited Washington Monument, White House and the downtown there. Had some icecream midway too and it was great. Now I am in Kent, Ohio with my sister and her husband. I will go to Nashville then to Mississippi to study a semester of Engineering at Mississippi State University. Then I plan to transfer to Hobart and William Smith College simply because I can. and they have a 3+2 engineering program with Dartmouth. Let's see where the life takes me.

And I think that's it. This is a short journal for now. I will update more later and HOPEFULLY CAN DO DAILY DIARIES.
