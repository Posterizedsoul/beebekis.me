## Seems like a display connector pins problem...

Last January, I think it should be January, no March, I had my laptop fixed. The repair dai said there was some rusting on the display connectors and took NRS 3,000 to fix it. Honestly it worked.

I am writing this on April and it worked flawlessly up until lastday. I had a total blackout of the screen. Whatever I did didn't work. I tried restarting it, complete long power shutdown, flushed the capacitors but nothing availed. I gave up and went on to to other things in my life that ~~honestly~~ I should have prioritized.

After a night of making veg Mo: Mo:..

I was tired and slept like I was drunk. In the morning, even with a slight prayer, I pressed the power the button. Low and behold, this plastic grabage woke up. And here I am writing this blog on the morning of 28th. I won't cheat saying I wrote this in 27th, because why should I. This is supposed to be a safe space in the internet that I can pour my thoughts.

Anyways..

I will add a few more things that might happen throughout the day at the night of 28th.. That's it up until this point.
