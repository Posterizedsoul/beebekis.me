## Honestly making website for ownself is kind of pain..

Took me a while to get <b>DIARY</b> right but I got diary setup correctly. Hopefully I am not writing dairy as diary. I am proud of this UI though I don't consider myself a frontend dev by any means. Half of the things are just copy pasta or AI slop in the frontend.

But it workssss...

And I think that what matters. From today I will try to write a daily journal to include whatever I can that happened throughout the day. I tried it before but I kind of failed as I would very much write technical stuff into that diary made for journal. I won't _try_ to use any grammarly thingy into this so that all the writing is raw. ðŸ’€
